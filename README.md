# AllTheNews

At a high level this is a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news.

At a more detailed level, this app is a full stack (frontend and backend) application that allows a user to scrape news articles (from a designated spot) a new burger and then click a button to 'devour it.' The app uses a modularized code base using a Model View Controller methodology and a Object-Document Mapping to access the mongo database.

## Technologies used 

* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* Node
* Mongoose
* Request
* Express
* Handlebars
* Axios
* Cheerio
* Object-Document Mapper (ODM)
* Model View Controller (MVC)

## Role in Development
I coded the front-end, server, database schema, and everything in between.
